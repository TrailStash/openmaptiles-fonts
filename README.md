# openmaptiles-fonts

Hosted fontstacks to serve with openmaptiles.

These fonts come from the
[openmaptiles/fonts](https://github.com/openmaptiles/fonts) repository. That
repository contains the code to generate these fontstacks, but the actual fonts
themselves are in the _releases_, and thus you can't point a style directly at
that repository.

This repository hosts the individual fontstack files, so you can just add
```
"glyphs": "https://trailstash.github.io/openmaptiles-fonts/fonts/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf"
```
to your style.

Please mind the license of the original fonts. All fonts are either licensed under OFL or Apache.
